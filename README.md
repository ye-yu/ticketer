Ticketer
---

Ticketer is a ticketing tool similar to Jira and Fiverr but offers their service on community level. Like Fiverr, Ticketer audiences include content-creators (or as Ticketer calls them, contributors) but the contents adhere to the request-showcase ticketing system. This also includes a public platform for publishing requests and a ticket-oriented management system.

Ticketer helps clients voice out their request effectively targeting specific communities and gaining more attention based on their ticket votes. Contributors can also use this platform to display their output from a requested ticket. How to use their content is up to the contributor and their licensing.

Here's a few comparisons for Ticketer, [Jira][1], and Fiverr:

|   | **Ticketer**   | Jira | Fiver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Users   | Clients/Requestors and Contributor | Software dev, Project managers, SCRUM masters | Clients and Content creators |
| Use cases | Request tracking, Showcasing system | Bug tracking, Project management, etc. | [Gig system][2], Paid and personalised request |

Here's the system rule:
  - A client can post a request ticket (e.g. for an artist to draw new a concept art) under a certain community (e.g. a gaming community).
  - A contributor can claim a request ticket. That means the contributor will work on the ticket as requested.
  - A request ticket can be claimed by many contributors and will be duplicated as a progress ticket when it is claimed.
  - A contributor can post a showcase ticket (i.e. the final output of the request ticket).
  - Anyone can bump a stale ticket (a request ticket that has been claim but has shown no progress, or a showcase ticket that is outdated).
  - Anyone can vote on a ticket to give an extra attention to the ticket.
  - A client will gain reputation points based on the votes on their ticket.
  - A contributor will gain reputation points based on the vote of their output.
