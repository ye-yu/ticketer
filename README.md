Ticketer
---

Ticketer is a ticketing tool similar to Jira and Fiverr but offers their service on community level. Like Jira, Ticketer uses a ticketing system to keep track of the request tickets, progress tickets, and showcase tickets. Like Fiverr, Ticketer's audiences include content-creators (or as Ticketer calls them, contributors), but the contents adhere to the request-showcase ticketing system.

Ticketer helps clients voice out their request effectively by targeting specific communities and gaining more attention based on their ticket votes. They do so by opening up a community request ticket and wait for contributors to fork (or to duplicate) their ticket into a progress ticket. Afterwards, contributors can update their progress ticket while working on it. When they have finally finished their ticket, they will fork their progress ticket into a showcase ticket displaying their output. How to use their content is up to the contributor and their licensing option.

Here's a few comparisons for Ticketer, [Jira][1], and Fiverr:

|   | **Ticketer**   | Jira | Fiver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Users   | Clients/Requestors and Contributor | Software dev, Project managers, SCRUM masters | Clients and Content creators |
| Use cases | Request tracking, Showcasing system | Bug tracking, Project management, etc. | [Gig system][2], Paid and personalised request |

Here's the system rule:
  - A request ticket is a ticket for displaying a clients request
  - A progress ticket is a fork of a request ticket for displaying the development progress of the client's request.
  - A showcase ticket is a fork of a progress ticket for display the final output of a request ticket.
  - A client can post a request ticket (e.g. for an artist to draw new a concept art) under a certain community (e.g. a gaming community).
  - A contributor can fork a request ticket into a progress ticket. That means the contributor will work on the ticket as requested.
  - A request ticket can be forked by many contributors into their own progress ticket.
  - A contributor can fork a progress ticket into a showcase ticket (i.e. the final output of the request ticket).
  - A progress ticket can still be updated after being forked into a showcase ticket.
  - Anyone can bump a stale ticket (a request ticket that has been claimed but has shown no progress, or a showcase ticket that is outdated) by paying with their reputation points.
  - Anyone can vote on a ticket to give an extra attention to the ticket.
  - A client will gain reputation points based on the votes on their ticket.
  - A contributor will gain reputation points based on the vote of their output.
